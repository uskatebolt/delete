<h2>What you need to do</h2>

<p>COVID-19 is spread mainly from person to person through close contact, for example, in a household, workplace or health care centre.</p>

<p>There is no vaccine available to protect against COVID-19, but there are things you should do to help prevent the spread of coronavirus that causes the disease.</p>

<h2>Everyday actions</h2>

<p>Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus and protect your health:</p>

<li>wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
	<li>sneeze and cough into your sleeve</li>
	<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
	<li>avoid contact with people who are sick</li>
	<li>stay home if you are sick</li>


<h2>Physical distancing</h2>

<p>Everyone in Ontario should practice physical distancing to reduce their exposure to other people — this means staying at least two metres away from anyone outside your household.</p>

<p>If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, you should begin to self-monitor for a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to physical distancing, you should track how you feel by:</p>

 <li>taking your temperature daily</li>
	<li>logging any other symptoms that develop (for example, sore throat, new cough)</li>
  <p>You can share these records with your primary care provider if you contact them for further advice.</p>

<h2>Face coverings and face masks</h2>

<p>The best way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is by staying home and avoiding close contact with others outside of your household.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you use a face covering (non-medical mask such as a cloth mask) to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 when physical distancing and keeping two-metres’ distance from others may be challenging or not possible.</p>

<p>Learn about face coverings, including how to properly fit, wear, remove and clean your non-medical face mask.</p>

<h2>How to self-isolate</h2>

<p>Self-isolating (quarantining) means staying at home and avoiding contact with other people to help prevent the spread of disease.</p>

<p>You should self-isolate if you are:</p>

 <li>over 65 years of age</li>
	<li>have a chronic medical condition (for example, diabetes, lung problems, immune deficiency)</li>
	<li>think you may have symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <p>This means that you should leave your home or see other people for essential reasons only. Where possible, you should try to get what you need:</p>

 <li>online</li>
	<li>over the phone</li>
	<li>from friends, family or neighbours</li>
  <h3>Stay home</h3>

 <li>do not use public transportation, taxis or rideshares</li>
	<li>do not go to work, school or other public places</li>
	<li>your health care provider will tell you when it is safe to leave</li>
  <h2>Limit the number of visitors in your home</h2>

 <li>only have visitors who you must see and keep the visits short</li>
        <li>do not visit with people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, meaning: </li>
	 <li>seniors</li>
		<li>people with chronic medical conditions (for example, diabetes, lung problems, immune deficiency)</li>
	  
  <h2>Avoid contact with others</h2>

 <li>stay in a separate room, away from other people in your home, as much as possible and use a separate bathroom if you have one</li>
	<li>make sure that shared rooms have good airflow (for example, open windows)</li>
  <h2>Wear a mask</h2>

 <li>ensure the mask covers your nose and mouth and wear it: </li>
	 <li>if you leave your house to see a health care provider</li>
		<li>when you are within two metres of other people</li>
	  
  <h2>Keep distance</h2>

 <li>if you are in a room with other people, stay at least two metres away from each other and wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth</li>
	<li>if you cannot wear a mask, people should wear a mask when they are in the same room as you</li>
  <h2>Cover your coughs and sneezes</h2>

 <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze</li>
	<li>if you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow, not your hand</li>
	<li>throw used tissues in a wastebasket that’s lined with a plastic bag </li>
	 <li>the plastic bag makes it safer and easier to empty the wastebasket</li>
		<li>after emptying the wastebasket, wash your hands</li>
	  
  <h3>Wash your hands</h3>

 <li>wash your hands often with soap and water</li>
	<li>dry your hands with a paper towel, or with your own cloth towel that no one else shares</li>
	<li>use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available</li>
  <p>Read the Government of Canada’s guidance on how to self-isolate if you have:</p>

 <li>symptoms of COVID-19</li>
	<li>no symptoms but are in a high-risk group or have recently returned from travel</li>
